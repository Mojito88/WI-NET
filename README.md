# WI-NET
speak, this is your power, don't let anyone stop you from doing it!
WI-NET is going to be a full privacy project to connect people to talk, an open source project for everyone.

# Current bug not already fixed:
> Client&server must stop sending and start listening <br/>
> Exiting bind for not keep port busy until os close that

# 1° Phase

- [x] Bug Fixing 
- [x] Compress Code 
- [x] working on essential GUI 
- [x] Sending key to server 
- [x] Server reciving key

> Why the server listener is inside the repository? first of all to avoid losing it, then, it will be there forever if someone will help me to develop it better or general hints.
> What is the key? key aren't gonna be uploaded on github cz server will take them from local file.
> Are gonna our key will be in a safe place? That's imposssible to say, every server can be exploited but i'll do my best to keep them hidden.

:construction: Working on, stay tuned :loudspeaker: :construction:
# 2° Phase
- [ ] Verify key
- [ ] Send GUI label
- [ ] Reciving data label

> Why verifyng key is important?
> Keys will be 32 characters/num combination necessary to obtain the right message from server.
> Will server send me someone else message? No. it will just send you random error and report that to the sender.


# 3° Phase
- [ ] Encryption
- [ ] Distributing keys
- [ ] Tor servers implementation

> Why TOR server will be implemented? Your message will be encrypted on your own computer and delivered passing trought TOR servers.
> Does my message will be untraceable? No, few people will be able to trace it but you and your target will be the only two able to read it.
> What tipe of encryption will WI-NET use? I'm going to work on a new tipe of encryption right after Phase 2 based on 1028 b string or more.
